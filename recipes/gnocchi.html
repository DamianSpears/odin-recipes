    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gnocchi is a potato based pasta that is considered delicious by many. 
        Not only is it delicious, but it is also extremely versatile. This type of pasta
        can be dressed in many different sauces and paired with a variety of proteins. Some Recipes
        have even called for it to be cooked twice before serving.</p>

    <p>While there are many options for preparing gnocchi, we are going to focus on a popular approach: pesto gnocchi.
        Pesto is a sauce derived from oils and herbs and has an fresh, aromatic scent to it. Pesto is a mild, rich sauce that
        has little to no spice. Pesto can be paired with a variety of meats including shrimp, sausage, chicken, and lamb. 
        In this recipe, we will be using shrimp as our protein.</p>
